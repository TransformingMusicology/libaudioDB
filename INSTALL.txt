Dependencies
------------

gsoap: audioDB uses libgsoap++ for SOAP Web Services support.  This
       can be installed on most linux distributions using the package
       manager; the binary distribution will suffice.  Other systems
       will need to install the library.

gengetopt: audioDB uses gengetopt (as of 2007-10-23, version 2.18
           exactly) for command-line parsing.

help2man: a spartan manual page is automatically generated from the
          usage text using help2man.

bash: audioDB's test suite depends on /bin/sh being bash, version 3.0
      or greater.

gsl: the GNU Scientific Library.

Compiling
---------

Use the following make commands to compile audioDB on your system:

Linux:         make
(Debian-derived systems, with the right versions of gengetopt, gsoap
and help2man installed)

OS X or Win32: make \
  GENGETOPT=/path/to/bin/gengetopt \
  SOAPCPP2=/path/to/bin/soapcpp2 \
  GSOAP_CPP=/path/to/gsoap/stdsoap2.cpp \
  GSOAP_INCLUDE="-I /path/to/gsoap" \
  LIBGSL="-L/path/to/libgsl/libraries -lgsl -lgslcblas"
(where the path in GSOAP_INCLUDE should name the directory in which
stdsoap2.h resides)

Testing
-------

audioDB comes with a suite of test scripts that verify that particular
pieces of functionality are behaving acceptably.  They depend on
/bin/sh being GNU bash, version 3 or greater.  The test suite can be
run with the command "make test".

When running on systems without sparse file support (notably those
using the default filesystem in Mac OS X), running the test suite
requires approximately 70GB of free hard disk space.  On other
systems, disk usage from running the test suite is negligible.

Installation
------------

The audioDB executable is command-line database client, SOAP server
and SOAP client all in one: to install for system-wide use, simply
copy it to a place in the system-wide path.

The build process also generates a Web Service Description file,
adb.wsdl; to publish a description of an audioDB web service, you will
need to edit that file to point to the network address and port of
your audioDB server before publishing it on an ordinary HTTP server.
